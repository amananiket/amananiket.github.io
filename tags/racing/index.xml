      <description>I have never been a racing person. What I have always enjoyed and found challenging though is the ultra aspect of things. Having said that, there&amp;rsquo;s that thrill you get from speed which is all but a different flavor of the sport. So when The Champions Sportive was announced, which essentially is planned to be a set of 102K competitive races across 8 cities of the country. This is the first edition and Bangalore was the first city to host it.</description>
