      <description>Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m a liberal. I&amp;rsquo;m a nationalist and by association of the republic of India being a liberal democracy, I become a liberal. But wait, I was born a Hindu and India being a admittedly secular country, I inherited the religion.
 I&amp;rsquo;m many more nouns if I keep on thinking about it which raises the question, what indeed is religion? Why do we unquestionably follow a religion? Some of us have no second thoughts about how the creation of the universe played out owing to our dogmas derived from religious texts, but a lot of others indeed have a part of us questioning constantly about the gaps in our understanding.</description>
