      <description>I had always wanted to host my own blog. I guess I was just too lazy to actually write one from scratch. But what you see is indeed a work conceived and built bottom-up and not a clone. I&amp;rsquo;m proud of myself that I could come around convincing myself that I should do this. For the interested reader, this website is built on the Hugo framework with Cactus theme. Building yourself one like this is pretty easy and should be a matter of minutes if you know your way around code.</description>
