      <description>Ever since I started attempting long distances on the cycle which was roughly at the beginning of 2017, I have always looked for out-and-back destinations which
 Have a healthy amount of climb. Approachable mileage given my current conditioning.  Given my last outing was an around 200k affair, I wanted to really try myself out this time. The last one had been to the Avalabetta peak in the mid-April scorching heat.</description>

      <description>I am asked by my mother, “Why do you cycle so much? Planning to go to the US to meet your brother?”. She already thinks bigger than me.
 Being one? Guess what, I didn’t decide to be one, one fine day. It just came to me in the form of the beautiful sport of Running. I started running because I had lost touch with any form of activity. I was in sophomore year of college, and running seemed liked the best way to start embarrassing myself lesser when on a weighing scale.</description>

      <description>Avalabetta is a beautiful hilltop located around 100 kms from Bangalore. It is an ideal place for a short trip with great scenery to offer.
 The mountain biking bug first bit me after incidentally joining a YHAI 7 day trip to Jalori Pass. Nearly a year later, I was about to attempt cycling around 200 kms in a day. I had been cycling around 25–30 kms a day for 6 months now so I knew I had the conditioning, but a long stretch of cycling brings a handful of challenges with it, the intense 35 degrees arid weather topping the list for me.</description>
